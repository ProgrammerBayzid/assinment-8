                 <h1 className='text-center font-extrabold text-4xl mb-5'>Question: How Dose React Work</h1>
                 <h1 className='ml-10 mr-10 text-2xl mb-10'><span className='font-bold'>Answe</span>: React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. 'V' denotes the view in MVC. ReactJS is an open-source, component-based front end library responsible only for the view layer of the application.</h1>




                 <h1 className='text-center font-extrabold text-4xl mb-5'>Question:Props And State Different</h1>
                 <h1 className='ml-10 mr-10 text-2xl mb-10'><span className='font-bold'>Answe</span>: Simply put, State is the local state of the component which cannot be accessed and modified outside of the component. It's equivalent to local variables in a function. Props, on the other hand, make components reusable by giving components the ability to receive data from their parent component in the form of props.</h1>

                 <h1 className='ml-10 mr-10 text-2xl mb-10'><span className='font-bold'>Answe</span>: What does useEffect do? By using this Hook, you tell React that your component needs to do something after render. React will remember the function you passed (we'll refer to it as our “effect”), and call it later after performing the DOM updates.  </h1>
